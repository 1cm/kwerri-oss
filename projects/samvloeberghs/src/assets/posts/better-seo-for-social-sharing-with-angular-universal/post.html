    It’s not a new concept, running Angular on the server with Universal. The first version of this website was build
    with Angular v2 and Universal concepts back in November 2016. The tooling around it has grown a lot since then and
    my website evolved with those tooling updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s much easier building an Angular universal website or app today because it’s <a
    href="https://angular.io/guide/universal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">completely documented</a> and there are a
    lot of <a href="https://github.com/angular/universal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">example projects</a>
    available. Angular CLI also gives us the tooling to add the functionality automatically by <a
    href="https://github.com/angular/universal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">simple commands</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the fact that SPAs in general have big problems with indexing and social sharing has been a topic for many
    discussions. Different approaches have been considered and one of them, like prerendering and serving different
    content for different consumers, bots vs real visitors, can be categorized as <a

  <p>
    This article and guide on better SEO for social sharing with Angular Universal is targeted to developers that have a
    good understanding of Angular and might already have an Angular Universal implementation running. We are going to
    describe some services that will enable better social sharing on for example Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>
    The idea
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    When you generate an Angular application via the angular-cli a <code>polyfills.ts</code> file gets generated. It
    includes the
    following content:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">/** IE9, IE10, IE11, and Chrome <55 requires all of the following polyfills.
* This also includes Android Emulators with older versions of Chrome
* and Google Search/Googlebot
*/
</code></pre>

  <p>
    This means that our Angular app has support for the Google Search / Googlebot, even without SSR, if we include those
    specific
    polyfills. This does not mention any other search engines. The other typical search engines, like
    Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, etc have problems parsing JavaScript heavy websites, like SPAs, applications that use
    frameworks like for example jQuery.
  </p>

  <p>
    The overview below gives us a good idea about which search engines are capable of indexing JavaScript heavy
    applications, build with different frameworks and libraries.

    If you want to read more about this topic, I suggest reading
    <a href="https://moz.com/blog/search-engines-ready-for-javascript-crawling" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://moz.com/blog/search-engines-ready-for-javascript-crawling</a>.
    The blogpost is a little bit outdated as the crawlers have most likely evolved in their capabilities, but the
    general idea remains: <strong>Search engines are, in general, not very capable of rendering JavaScript while
    indexing</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>
    Google, Bing and others are not the only search engines
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Everything that is described above is also true for other crawlers, like those of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn,
    just to name a few of the social media platforms I consider to be important for my cases. These can also be
    considered search engines, because they parse and cache the content of your website or application when users
    are sharing your content.
  </p>

  <p>
    And just like the other typical search engines, most of them, if not all, are not capable of parsing JavaScript and
    only rely on the statically generated HTML.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>
    How do social media platforms crawl your page?
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Social media platforms use your statically generated HTML to show a preview when sharing one of
    your pages on their feed. Therefor they parse the <code>title</code> and <code>meta</code> tags that can be found in
    the <code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</code>
    tag.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="html highlighted">&#x3C;!doctype html&#x3E;
&#x3C;html lang=&#x22;en&#x22;&#x3E;
   &#x3C;head&#x3E;
      &#x3C;meta charset=&#x22;utf-8&#x22;&#x3E;
      &#x3C;title&#x3E;Sam Vloeberghs - Freelance Webdeveloper &#x26;amp; Software Engineer&#x3C;/title&#x3E;
      &#x3C;meta name=&#x22;description&#x22; content=&#x22;Hi there! &#x1F44B; Thank you for visiting my website!&#x22;&#x3E;
      &#x3C;meta name=&#x22;author&#x22; content=&#x22;Sam Vloeberghs&#x22;&#x3E;
   &#x3C;/head&#x3E;
   ...</code></pre>

  <p class="alert alert-warning">
    <i class="fa fa-warning"></i>
    This seems easy, but it's not that easy to get it right. Because <strong>all the different social media platforms
    expect other <code>meta</code> tags</strong> for rendering their previews. They don't even use the same attribute to
    identify the
    correct <code>meta</code> tags. Some use the <code>name</code> attribute and others use the <code>property</code>
    attribute. It means you'll have to support around 15 different <code>meta</code> tags to get it right (for Facebook,
    LinkedIn and Twitter).
  </p>

  <p>
    All of the discussed social media platforms provide us with tools to <strong>validate our pages or posts before
    sharing them</strong>. Some platforms, like Facebook and LinkedIn cache all the shared content, so these tools also
    allows us to <em>invalidate cached content</em>. Super handy if you have already shared your page before, or if you
    want to invalidate the cache of a set of pages in one go.

  <h3>
    <span>
    Facebook
    </span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    To get your post to show correctly on Facebook you need to implement the following basic <code>meta</code> tags.
    Please
    note that Facebook uses the <code>property</code> attribute to define the type of <code>meta</code> value and that
    those types are always prefixed with <code>og:</code>, which is the prefix for the open-graph protocol.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="html highlighted">&#x3C;head&#x3E;

  &#x3C;meta property=&#x22;og:image:alt&#x22; content=&#x22;Sam Vloeberghs - Freelance Webdeveloper &#x26;amp; Software Engineer&#x22;&#x3E;
  &#x3C;meta property=&#x22;og:image:height&#x22; content=&#x22;xxx&#x22;&#x3E;
  &#x3C;meta property=&#x22;og:image:width&#x22; content=&#x22;xxx&#x22;&#x3E;
&#x3C;/head&#x3E;</code></pre>

  <p>
    The open-graph protocol allows for a lot more <code>meta</code> tags to be defined. Especially Facebook supports a
    lot more, like video. Check the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters" rel="noopener"
                                       target="_blank">documentation

  <h3>
    <span>
    LinkedIn
    </span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    To get your post to show correctly on LinkedIn you need to implement the following basic <code>meta</code> tags.
    Please
    note that LinkedIn also uses the <code>og:</code> prefixes, but not for all values, like the author
    <code>meta</code> tag.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="html highlighted">&#x3C;head&#x3E;

  </p>

  <p>
    The only thing I'm still not sure about is which <code>meta</code> <code>property</code> or <code>name</code> they
    use to correctly read out the "Publish date". I have asked the question to their support and I'm still waiting for
    the answer. And sadly there is little to no documentation to be found..

  <h3>
    <span>
    Twitter
    </span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    To get your post to show correctly on Twitter as a card you need to implement the following <code>meta</code> tags.
    Please
    note that, <em>compared to Facebook and LinkedIn,</em> Twitter uses the <code>name</code> attribute to define the
    type of <code>meta</code> value and that
    those types are always prefixed with <code>twitter:</code>.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="html highlighted">&#x3C;head&#x3E;

  <h2>
    <span>
    Using the Meta and Title services in Angular
    </span>
  </h2>

  <h2>
    <span>
    Watch out for over optimization
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    When generating static pages on the server side you might consider optimizing the rendered HTML as well. Tools like
    <a href="https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HTMLMinifier</a> take out all the
    bloat from your HTML, to keep the bare minimum that the browser need to be capable of rendering it.
  </p>
  <p>
    But be careful. Browsers like Chrome, Firefox and others are able to parse your minified HTML, as they are
    very forgiving and fix errors for us. But parsers that rely heavily on structured HTML, like the ones the social
    platforms use, might not be able to parse it correctly and get out the information they need.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>
    A simple example
    </span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    The following minify options strip out all the stuff the browser does not need to correctly show your page:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript highlighted">const tooMuchHtmlMinifyOptions = {
    removeComments: true,
    removeCommentsFromCDATA: true,
    collapseWhitespace: true,
    collapseBooleanAttributes: true,
    removeRedundantAttributes: true,
    useShortDoctype: true,
    removeEmptyAttributes: true,
    minifyCSS: true,
    removeAttributeQuotes: true,
    removeOptionalTags: true
};

const minify = require('html-minifier').minify;
const minifiedHtml = minify(html, minifyOptions);</code></pre>

  <p>
    Now, processing the following HTML:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="html highlighted">&#x3C;!doctype html&#x3E;
&#x3C;html lang=&#x22;en&#x22;&#x3E;
   &#x3C;head&#x3E;
      &#x3C;meta charset=&#x22;utf-8&#x22;&#x3E;
      &#x3C;meta property=&#x22;og:title&#x22; content=&#x22;Sam Vloeberghs - Freelance Webdeveloper &#x26;amp; Software Engineer&#x22;&#x3E;
      ...</code></pre>
  <p>
    results in
  </p>

  <pre><code
    class="html highlighted">&#x3C;!doctype html&#x3E;&#x3C;html lang=en&#x3E;&#x3C;meta charset=utf-8&#x3E;&#x3C;meta property=og:title content=&#x22;Sam Vloeberghs - Freelance Webdeveloper &#x26;amp; Software Engineer&#x22;&#x3E;</code></pre>

  <p>
    This is too much optimization for for example the LinkedIn Post Inspector. If you look close enough, you'll notice
    that the
    optional <code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</code> tag was removed and that the quotes around simple attribute values, with a
    single non-spaced value were removed. To be able to minify the HTML and keep the LinkedIn Post Inspector happy we
    need to change our configuration options a little bit. We have to keep the attribute quotes and don’t remove
    optional tags tag:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript highlighted">const goodHtmlMinifyOptions = {
    …
    removeAttributeQuotes: true,
    removeOptionalTags: true
};</code></pre>

  <p>
    Now the same HTML mentioned above, processed with these less drastic minify options, results in
  </p>

  <pre><code class="html highlighted">&#x3C;!doctype html&#x3E;&#x3C;html lang=&#x22;en&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;head&#x3E;&#x3C;meta charset=&#x22;utf-8&#x22;&#x3E;</code></pre>

  <p>
    We are keeping the <code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</code> tag and the attribute quotes. And now the LinkedIn Post Inspector
    is happy :).
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>
    Conclusion
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Not all search engines behave the same way. <em>Not only Google, Bing etc. can be categorized as search
    engines</em> but we have to think about Social platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, that also crawl
    and cache external content. <em>Each crawler behaves in a different way</em> and most of them are not capable of
    parsing JavaScript heavy applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means we have to <em>program and configure our applications very specifically for the different
    crawlers</em> of the social platforms we want to support. By using Angular Universal, we are sable to generate a
    static version of your application on the server and output static HTML. When minifying this static HTML we need to
    be careful and <em>keep our HTML as strict and structured as possible</em>.
