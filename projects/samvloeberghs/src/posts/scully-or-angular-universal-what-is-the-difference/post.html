        Disabling Angular when statically generating with Scully

      Scully or Angular Universal, what is the difference?
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Target audience</h2>

  <p>
    You might already be at the stage where you figured out that you need the full HTML of your generated pages
    delivered to the client by the server, and not just the static assets that bootstrap your Angular application in the
    browser, in order to reach the desired performance and capabilities like proper SEO and social network shareable
    Angular routes.
  </p>

  <p>
    To achieve this we currently have two different options. Implementing Universal techniques into our Angular
    application, or using Scully, the static site generator for Angular. Both will give us the same result; a performant
    Angular application. <strong>But what is the difference? When to use Universal, or when to use Scully? Let's try to
    find out!</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>How does Universal work?</h2>

  <p>
    Reading the title of this article might confuse you. We are not actually completely disabling Angular, because
    we are still building the application using Angular.
  </p>

  <h4>Key consideration points for Universal</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>(DOUBT) dynamic server required, static webserver insufficient</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How does Scully work</h2>

  <p>
    Reading the title of this article might confuse you. We are not actually completely disabling Angular, because
    we are still building the application using Angular.
  </p>

  <h4>Key consideration points for Scully</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>(PRO) Generated using a real browser (Chromium), so more support for 3rd party libraries, out of the Angular
      ecosystem
    </li>
    <li>(PRO) Intention / planned features to work with other frameworks, like React, Vue, ..</li>
    <li>No dynamic webserver required, static webserver sufficient</li>
    <li>(DOUBT) Extra build step / setup required</li>
    <li>(CON) Extra build step, no foolproof wait for stable app</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    Both Scully and Universal have their own use cases, plus they related tackle problems differently. So the logical
    choice to make totally depends on your project, its dependencies and how strict you want to write Angular code.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>My personal advice:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you have an existing project with a relatively big codebase, and you feel that adding Universal
      might be a lot of work, take a few hours to implement Scully. You might already receive the value you need!
    </li>
    <li>
      If you start from scratch, and you expect not to rely heavily on 3rd party libraries out of the Angular ecosystem
      think about starting with Angular Universal.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This technique is <strong>not suitable for all Angular applications</strong>, because we might need some
    functionality of the
    framework when our application is rendered in the browser. If that is the case, and the functionality is limited,
    <strong>consider moving this logic into a separate JavaScript file</strong>.
