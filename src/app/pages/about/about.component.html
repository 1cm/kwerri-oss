<p class="intro">
  I'm a 30 year old software engineer living in Belgium. At the time of writing I'm working as a technical lead /
  frontend architect at the biggest telco operator in Belgium, Proximus. We are doing some cool stuff with Electron
  and integrating a web application with a Windows environment using Electron-edge. I've also done some PHP in the
  past, but focussing totally on JavaScript, Angular, HTML5 and everything frontend from now on!

  I'm educated as an Engineer in Computer Science at the University of Ghent but learned my
  true passion, frontend, totally in my spare time. I'm playing around with websites since the age of 16 and still
  love it! Besides that I'm trying to understand the business side & the connection with IT a
  little bit more by attending an <a

  master in Enterprise IT Architecture</a> at <a href="http://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/">Antwerp Management
