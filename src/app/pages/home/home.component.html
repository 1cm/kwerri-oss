<h2>Whoami</h2>

<p>
    As you could have guessed my name is Sam Vloeberghs. I'm a 28 year old software engineer living in Belgium. At the
    time of writing I'm working as a technical lead / frontend architect at the biggest telco operator in Belgium,
    Proximus. We are doing some cool stuff with Electron and integrating a web application with a Windows environment
    using Electron-edge. I've also done some PHP in the past, but focussing totally on JavaScript, Angular, HTML5 and
    everything frontend from now on!

    I'm educated as an Engineer in Computer Science at the University of Ghent but learned my
    true passion, frontend, totally in my spare time. I'm playing around with websites since the age of 16 and still
    love it! Besides that I'm trying to understand the business side & the connection with IT a
    little bit more by attending an <a

<h2>Other people's oppinion</h2>
<p>
    As you can read from the short description it's me explaing myself. The best point of view comes from oppinions of
    other people. That's why I asked some of the most precious & valuable people in my world to describe me in a way
    they preferred:
