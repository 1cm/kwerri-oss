    <h2><span>Context</span></h2>
    <p>
        At <a href="https://sponsormatch.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SponsorMatch</a> we deploy an Angular
        Universal website & application that is shown in different languages. Currently we support Dutch(nl) and
        English(en). On the homepage we use a simple introduction video / explainimation to show how the product
        works. This video is made in English but for our Dutch-speaking market we provided Dutch subtitles.
    </p>

    <h2><span>Problem</span></h2>
    <p>
        It seems that it's not possible to set the default selected subtitle using the iframe embed solution. It's
        probably possible but anyway, I couldn't find any information on Google or on the Vimeo documentation. There are
        some questions on stackoverflow that remained unanswered for years:
    </p>

    <ul>

            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span>Solution</span></h2>
    <p>
        There are several solutions possible and one is moving completely to the JavaScript API Vimeo provides. More
        information can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/vimeo/player.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/vimeo/player.js</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The second solution I used was combining the iframe embed solution with the JS API. Basically we just use the
        iframe that was used for embedding as parameter in the Player constructor:
    </p>

    <h2><span>Using it in Angular</span></h2>

    <p>
        Using it in Angular is fairly easy.. We need to install the @vimeo/player package using yarn or npm:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash highlighted">npm i -S @vimeo/player</code></pre>
    <p>
        Next we can import the Player directly using:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">import Player from '@vimeo/player';</code></pre>

    <p>
        Using the <code>enableTextTrack</code> function we can easily set the language. As developers / implementors I
        believe we should be responsible in some way for knowing which languages are available to use. Meaning: which
        subtitles / texttracks are implemented on the embedded video.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">const player = new Player(document.getElementById('intro_explanimation'));

player.enableTextTrack(this.language, 'subtitles').then(function (track) {
    // track contains language, kind and label
}).catch(function (error) {
    // error holds what happened in detail
});</code></pre>

    <p>
        Please take a look at the complete example below:

            frameborder='0'

            mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen
